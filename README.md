# Platformer
My first proper attempt at making a game with MonoGame.

## Features so far
* Basic platformer physics/collisions
* Basic "camera" following
* Parallax background
* Different levels
* Two doors in each level, one to go to previous level, one to next level
* A black bar transition when restarting and when entering doors
* A level editor in a seperate program.

I've been interested in MonoGame/Xna for a while now, but never actually took the time to try to make something decently proper with it. But now, armed with the knowledge of making a basic platformer in gamemaker, making a crappy tetris clone in libgdx, and a couple years of playing with C#, I'm trying to make a platforming game in monogame. It won't be anything serious, it's mainly just practice.

I know the code is insanely unorganised and spaghetti-ey, but I'm just going with the flow. This is only practice after all. Don't look at this for reference on how to make a game.

To test the game, download one of the zip files, unpack it and find the executable in FirstProperGameAttempt\FirstProperGameAttempt\bin\Windows\x86\Debug (Windows only)

I know this is a terrible way to use github. I tried uploading the folder, but multiple files were missing, so I'll continue this for now, until I learn otherwise.
